            <h1>Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.</h1>
            <p>We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and creators being able to launch
                their own digital currency by simply creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible
                Tokens that can be owned and traded on the Tokners network</p>

                <h2>For <span>Creators</span></h2>
                <p>Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency system that is
                    dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own
                    10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.</p>

                <h2>For <span>Holders</span></h2>
                <p>Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to benefits including unreleased
                    content, private communities, direct access to celebrity, early-access to tickets and more as well
                    as the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with
                    early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more
                    buyers. </p>

                We would get them on our
                platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their
                digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their
                creator's currency increase <span>significantly</span> as they promote their digital currency across their
                channels while our native token holders benefit from the Tokners popularity.</p>
